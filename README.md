## How to Play?

* The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
* Two players take turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell.
* The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
* If all cells are filled, and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.
* You can click the "Reset" button to start a new game at any time.
